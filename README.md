# Single Phase Compact DC-AC Power Converter for Medium and High-Power Applications

This project implements a **Single Phase Compact DC-AC Power Converter** designed for medium and high-power applications. The proposed converter uses an asymmetrical multilevel inverter (MLI) topology to reduce the number of components and costs while improving performance. The topology employs **12 power switches** and **3 DC sources** to produce **19 voltage levels**, making it highly efficient for renewable energy integration, motor drives, and grid-tied systems.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to design and analyze a **single-phase DC-AC power converter** using an improved asymmetrical **multilevel inverter (MLI)** topology. The topology reduces the total component count, enhances reliability, and minimizes the overall system cost compared to traditional MLIs. The following features define the topology:

- **12 power switches** and **3 DC sources** generate **19 output voltage levels**.
- The use of **Nearest Level Control (NLC)** modulation reduces switching losses and enhances efficiency.
- Simulations were conducted using **MATLAB/Simulink** and **PLECS** software to evaluate the converter's performance under various loading conditions.
